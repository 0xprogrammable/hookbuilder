# Historical Submission V1 workflow

> Archived contract: use this chapter only to reproduce, recheck, or explicitly migrate an identified V1 application.
> Its one-token fields, fee assumptions, file limits, six-file package, `prepare-pr` command and unnamespaced GitHub
> client are not the creation or application contract for new Open-World V2/Application V3 projects. Start new work from
> [open-world-v2-workflow.md](open-world-v2-workflow.md) and
> [github-application-v3.md](github-application-v3.md).

For current projects, the GitHub sequence is namespaced and separate:
`open-world prepare-revision` derives revision/lineage through GET-only discovery, `open-world application` builds the
complete zero-network package, and `open-world submit|update|status` handles the review thread. Do not use this chapter's
`prepare-pr`, top-level `submit`, top-level `update`, or top-level `status` for Submission V2/Application V3.

The historical **Public GitHub PR Builder Beta** kept the complete project in the builder's own public GitHub
repository. A draft pull request carried one bounded six-file application record pointing to the exact public source
revision. No wallet connection, GitHub App installation, claim link, remote application draft, launch permit, or
connected application service was part of that beta.

## Resolve the active package contract first

This skill revision documents the released six-file Builder Beta package. A trusted intake channel may be migrating to
a different closed package, including a seven-file generation with central `launch.json`. Before scaffolding, repairing,
or reviewing, bind the exact default-branch workflow or service revision, PR target base, validator revision, allowed
filenames, package-contract id or digest, skill revision, criteria revision, and fee-policy version. Do not assume that
the target branch and the trusted workflow run the same generator.

`doctor` proves local tool readiness only. Resolve the channel contract read-only from immutable objects on the target
repository's current default branch: record the branch head/tree, relevant workflow and validator blob ids, package file
allowlist/schema id, published skill/criteria/fee revisions, and any separately deployed service revision supplied by the
platform. Compare those exact identities before generating. Until a released `resolve-contract` command exists, do not
describe `doctor` as channel-contract discovery.

If those authorities disagree, stop package generation and report `PACKAGE_CONTRACT_DRIFT`. Name the applicant action,
if any, separately from the platform release repair. Do not ask the applicant to guess which file set is authoritative,
do not hand-edit one generation into the other, and do not interpret a green structural check as semantic launch
readiness. The schema, generator, validator, documentation, and trusted workflow must be released as one coordinated
platform change.

Submission remains separate from the release registry. A builder can propose and test any reviewable v4 project without
creating the appearance that Programmable has selected, accepted, scheduled, deployed, or made it available.

Chain choice does not close the application door. Any positive JavaScript-safe EVM chain can be proposed. Ethereum,
Unichain, Base and Sepolia use the standard's exact canonical slugs; an unknown chain enters architecture review. The
current Programmable launch integration remains Ethereum Mainnet-only, so every non-Mainnet application carries a
separate release gate and cannot claim current platform launchability. Exact Base or Unichain official deployment
records remain a runtime-unverified reference tier, not Programmable-tested deployment evidence.

Submission standard `1.6.0` retains the mandatory Programmable volume-fee record, open project-surface and capability
graph, exact builder-template provenance, time-bounded per-provider evidence, and the machine-enforced v4 SDK safety
profile introduced in 1.5.0. It adds an open-ended `launchPlan`, one positive uint128
`pool.minimumInitialLiquidity`, exact launch source/test closure, and a required post-acceptance bundle for the generic
launch executor. It preserves unfamiliar games, maps,
services, databases, data sources, keepers, claims and later kinds for architecture review while deriving non-bypassable
security profiles from explicit triggers. It also separates a signed offchain data source from an optional onchain
oracle verifier. It retains explicit `official-launchpad` and `model-specific-no-hook` proposal paths and now permits
the same optional top-level `tokenMechanics` transfer-policy, transfer-tax, automatic-liquidity, provider-limit and test
profile with either `hook.used` value. Existing unpublished `1.4.0` drafts with those fields nested under
`noHookArchitecture` remain valid through deterministic fallback; matching duplicates are accepted and divergent
duplicates are blocked. A `1.5.0` or older submission is not
silently reinterpreted. Regenerate it from the current template; review every surface, capability, exposure, path,
profile, no-hook route, target chain, network slug, dependency and deployment trust tier; then commit the fresh report
and gate-status authority digests.

Use `assets/templates/token-mechanics.example.json` for new tax and automatic-liquidity drafts.
`assets/templates/no-hook-architecture.example.json` remains only as a backward-compatibility fixture for unpublished
drafts that predate the top-level profile.

The bundled fee record is policy `programmable-volume-fee-v1` version `1.1.0`. It requires independent cumulative
platform and project remainders for the canonical pool lifetime, forbids claims from resetting either remainder, rejects
positive gross quote amounts below 1,000 smallest units, and records `fragmentationResistant: true`. Per-swap floor
accounting is not compatible because splitting one swap into many can otherwise reduce the collected entitlement.

Every new launch application declares the root `programmableFee` object from
[programmable-fee-policy.md](programmable-fee-policy.md). Every idea remains submit-able, but no-hook, router-only,
LP-fee-only, and transfer-tax-only enforcement stays architecture- or changes-required. A simple launch implements the
standard Programmable fee-hook profile; a custom project integrates the policy into its single hook. Both require exact source, tests, and maintainer review.

## Stages

### Proposal

The builder repository contains:

- `submission.json`
- `PROPOSAL.md`
- `THREAT_MODEL.md`
- `TEST_PLAN.md`
- `EVIDENCE.md`
- Deterministic preflight report
- Builder identity, contact, license declaration, and optional beneficiary address

No implementation language is required at proposal stage. The proposal must still resolve the user outcome, project
surfaces, value flow, canonical PoolKey, whether its mandatory fee hook is standard-profile or integrates additional
project-defined behavior, authorities, dependencies, hard failure behavior, and expected evidence. Hook callbacks, a
permission mask, and CREATE2 planning apply only when `hook.used` is true. That value includes the standard fee-hook
profile; it does not imply extra custom behavior. A
no-hook proposal may select its applicable route and keep `programmableFee.collection.status` at
`pending-hook-integration`. It may reach `readiness.design: DESIGN_READY` when the integration plan is complete, but it
cannot claim `readiness.implementation: STRUCTURALLY_COMPLETE` or launch readiness.

### Prototype

Adds:

- Source for every declared contract, app, game, service, keeper, indexer, or other project surface
- A complete demonstrator for the declared creation-to-retirement path
- Unit, integration, and adversarial tests appropriate to the implemented capabilities
- Fuzz and invariant properties where state, value, authorization, or arithmetic requires them
- Pinned dependencies, languages, compilers, runtimes, and build configuration that the implementation actually uses
- `TEST_PLAN.md` with actual results separated from planned checks
- One hash-bound executable launch-plan artifact in the applicant repository, referenced through the existing
  implementation/specification and review-target paths

Solidity and Foundry evidence is required when Solidity is declared. A platform-launch-ready prototype additionally
requires exact source and tests for either a project-specific standard-profile hook or its integrated custom hook, including
callback authentication, permissions, fee accounting, owner-only claims, and CREATE2 evidence. Apps, games, and
services also provide the relevant source closure, build and test evidence for their declared surfaces.

A prototype provides builder-declared implementation evidence for review. A clean document-only analysis remains
`IN_PROGRESS`; closed repository/package structure may reach `STRUCTURALLY_COMPLETE`. Neither state means an evidence
command ran, a build was reproduced, or a sandbox verified the implementation. It is not accepted, audited, approved
for deployment, launchable, provider-supported, or available by default.

## Maintainer candidate state

A contributor cannot set `stage` to `candidate`. Maintainers may select an exact reviewed prototype commit as a
candidate after confirming:

- Complete declared source and supported dependency closure
- All capability-triggered tests and security documents
- Mandatory fee source and tests proving the floor, non-additive split, four swap modes, canonical-pool basis,
  immutable owner-only claims, no mutable recipient, no cross-pool netting, and non-bypassability
- Static-analysis dispositions
- Gas and size evidence for deployed contracts
- Pinned-chain lifecycle and current-head smoke evidence for surfaces that touch chain state
- Reproducible permission mask and CREATE2 plan when a custom hook is used
- Complete executable launch plan with ABI-checked targets, dependency order, initialization, liquidity/custody,
  atomicity boundaries, required platform capability ids, and postconditions
- Deployment plan for deployable components without credentials or signed transactions
- UI, app, game, service, router, indexer, monitoring, and incident requirements for intended surfaces
- All independent reviews required at candidate selection by the risk tier

Candidate selection is not acceptance, deployment, routing approval or availability.

### Launch-admission self-check

Apply [approval-criteria.md](approval-criteria.md) before preparing a launch-admission result. A proposal may receive
architecture feedback, but only an executable prototype can receive a positive launch-admission verdict. Keep the
current central six-file contract unchanged; the applicant launch plan remains a bound public-source artifact until a
trusted central schema and compiler are released together.

Report exactly one predicted verdict: `CHANGES REQUIRED` for any applicant-controlled blocker, `PLATFORM PENDING` only
after every applicant gate passes and only maintainer/provider work remains, or `READY FOR FINAL VERIFICATION` when
the supported platform pre-final gates also pass. None of these strings creates an acceptance record or launch permit.

### Acceptance and availability are separate

These are maintainer-owned release states, not submission stages. An acceptance record binds an exact model version,
commit, submission hash, review-target hash, builder, license, scope, open conditions, and any agreed beneficiary and
fee allocation. Acceptance does not authorize product edits, deployment, provider submissions, or activation.

Availability is later. It additionally requires exact deployment, source, runtime, lifecycle, product-integration,
monitoring, routing, discovery, and production evidence.

## Directory layouts

### Builder-controlled public project repository

```text
<project-root>/
├── .programmable/companions/          # optional exact-revision bindings
│   └── <surface>.json
├── submissions/<application-id>/
│   ├── submission.json
│   ├── compatibility-report.json
│   ├── PROPOSAL.md
│   ├── THREAT_MODEL.md
│   ├── TEST_PLAN.md
│   └── EVIDENCE.md
├── <declared project source and configuration>
└── <declared project tests and evidence>
```

Prototype submissions add `submissions/<application-id>/evidence/` plus source and tests under that project's existing
conventions. Do not put executable source inside Markdown or generated evidence files. The builder repository is the
source identity; every reviewed file must be bound to its clean, pushed commit and Git tree.

Projects split across repositories may declare up to eight additional public GitHub repositories. Each companion
manifest must be canonical JSON committed in the primary repository's exact HEAD and contains only
`schemaVersion`, `repositoryUri`, a full `revisionObjectId`, sorted `sourcePaths`, and sorted `contractPaths`.
`prepare-pr` resolves the companion's immutable numeric repository id and root tree independently. A branch, tag,
private repository, credentialed URL, local path, ZIP, pasted source, symlink, gitlink, or Git LFS pointer is not an
accepted source binding.

Keep every bound public source commit anonymously retrievable from the same numeric repository id until the identical
final-verification path has retained the reviewed source bundle. Do not delete and recreate a repository under the same
slug, make it private, transfer it without reauthorization, force-push away the declared immutable review ref, remove a
submodule or LFS object, or otherwise make the commit unreachable. A rename that preserves the numeric id may be
revalidated; deletion and recreation is a new source authority and invalidates prior positive evidence.

### Programmable central application pull request

```text
submissions/<application-id>/
├── application.json
├── PROPOSAL.md
├── TEST_PLAN.md
├── THREAT_MODEL.md
├── compatibility-report.json
└── evidence-index.json
```

These are the exact six allowed central files. `prepare-pr` deterministically derives them from the builder package and
the independently resolved public GitHub revision. Do not copy `submission.json`, `EVIDENCE.md`, project source, tests,
build output, dependency directories, or workflows into the central repository. `applicationId` is the stable lowercase
project slug and directory name. The GitHub pull-request number is the public review thread, not a connected-service
application identity.

The local report's `readiness.design` and `readiness.implementation` fields are authoritative. Its legacy `decision`
field is retained for one report-v3 migration release and marked `decisionCompatibility: LEGACY_COMPATIBILITY_ONLY`:
`PROTOTYPE_READY` never means an implementation exists or passed builds and tests. The builder does not emit local
`PROTOTYPE_VALIDATED` or `SANDBOX_REBUILD_VERIFIED`. The official generator retains the unavoidable
candidate and maintainer gates and therefore does not legitimately emit central `prototype-ready` today.
Until trusted-base intake reconstructs the exact review target and source/evidence blob digests, a hand-edited central
claim fails with `PROTOTYPE_READY_REQUIRES_TRUSTED_REVIEW_TARGET`. Submit the generated
`architecture-review-required`, `changes-required`, or `tooling-blocked` result and let maintainer review advance the
public record.

`prepare-pr` also resolves the declared builder login through GitHub's anonymous public user endpoint. It writes the
lossless decimal `githubUserId` as immutable builder identity and keeps `githubLogin` plus `contact` as display data.
The trusted workflow requires the id and current login to match the pull-request author, preserves the id on revisions,
and permits a login rename. Never hand-enter or infer the numeric id from a profile URL.

## Scaffold

Resolve the skill installation and target repository separately:

```bash
SKILL_ROOT="<directory-containing-this-SKILL.md>"
REPOSITORY_ROOT="$(git -C "$PWD" rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
APPLICATION_ID="example-project"
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" scaffold \
  "$APPLICATION_ID" \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT" \
  --name "<Model name>" \
  --template-plan "$REPOSITORY_ROOT/path/to/programmable-template.json"
```

Use `--template-plan` only with the unchanged `programmable-template.json` created by the catalog materializer. The
scaffold verifies and preserves its catalog digest, selection digest, starter, requested/default/automatic/selected
packs, the capabilities derived from those exact entries, owner-defined capabilities, owner-provided local tags and
complete internal provenance tags. It reconstructs the selection from the bundled reviewed catalog, so a
self-consistent but invented catalog, starter, pack or capability set is rejected. Only owner-provided tags are copied
to `publicMetadata.localDiscoveryTags`; internal pack, capability and security ids are not published. Omit the option
for an explicitly manual submission; `builderTemplate.source` then remains `manual` and `templateSelection` remains
`null`. The current direct command exposes the same option on `scaffold-submission.mjs`.

Every selected catalog capability and owner-defined capability must remain represented by the same id in
`projectCapabilities` or `capabilityExtensions`. A missing bridge is a repairable architecture blocker, never an
automatic unsafe or unsupported-category verdict.

Before the first release that changes the catalog digest, add an append-only retained snapshot registry containing the
complete hash-verified definitions needed to reconstruct every previously released digest. Never delete or silently
rewrite a retained snapshot. Until such a snapshot exists, an otherwise self-consistent non-current digest stays
submittable only as `BUILDER_TEMPLATE_CATALOG_HISTORY_UNVERIFIED` and requires explicit history review; it must never be
reported as the current catalog, auto-approved, or treated as an unsafe project.

The scaffold creates only a submission package. It does not modify `models/registry.json`, create an acceptance record,
open a pull request, or publish anything.

## Validate

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" check \
  "submissions/$APPLICATION_ID/submission.json" \
  --write-report "submissions/$APPLICATION_ID/compatibility-report.json" \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT"

node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" package \
  "submissions/$APPLICATION_ID" \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT"
```

Without a `--require-*` flag, `check` exit code `0` means the report was generated, even when blockers remain. Its
machine-readable `commandOutcome.zeroExitMeaning` is `REPORT_GENERATED_ONLY_NOT_READINESS` in that mode. Use
`--require-design-ready` or `--require-intake-ready` when the exit code must enforce that local gate; neither proves
independent prototype validation, acceptance, deployment, routing, or launch readiness.

Commit the generated report. If the design changes, regenerate it. CI should fail when the report no longer matches the
submission contents or standard version. Every package preserves the authoritative `readiness.design` and
`readiness.implementation` fields. A proposal may also preserve the legacy `REDESIGN_REQUIRED` or `UNSUPPORTED`
projection so older consumers can discuss the design, but that projection does not replace the axes. Prototype
packages require `readiness.implementation: STRUCTURALLY_COMPLETE`; legacy `PROTOTYPE_READY` alone is insufficient.

`REDESIGN_REQUIRED` does not make an empty scaffold application-ready. A proposal package must replace the generated
instructions with a concrete idea, base architecture, lifecycle, value flows, authority inventory or explicit
no-authority statement, failure response, and project-specific proposal, threat model, test plan, and evidence status.
It may retain specific named architecture questions in `unresolved`; each question must identify the actual decision
instead of repeating a generic template task. `package` rejects placeholder fields and substantially unchanged scaffold
documents before `prepare-pr` performs any public-source work.

`check` also records `closure.status` and closed diagnostics for the exact repository. A proposal may retain an
incomplete closure for aliases, bundler globs, runtime module selection, a language without a bundled scanner, a
non-Foundry Solidity build profile, or a separately pinned companion repository; its central result remains
`architecture-review-required` when no independent design blocker requires changes. `--require-intake-ready`, its
deprecated `--require-ready` alias, prototype
packaging, and prototype `prepare-pr` stay blocked until that closure is proven. Missing literal relative files, unsafe
paths, symlinks, Gitlinks or unmaterialized LFS source are source-binding errors, not architecture-review shortcuts.

The prototype package gate also checks the complete compatibility report, dependency lock, declared file closure, gate
evidence hashes, and review-target hash. Solidity import and compiler-resolved source closure applies when Solidity is
declared. Static or literal local JavaScript and TypeScript module closure applies when those languages are declared.
Other languages and project types enter the matching supported tooling gate or an explicit architecture/tooling review;
they are not mislabeled as Solidity failures. Arbitrary runtime loading is outside the static proof: it remains
proposal-eligible with an explicit incomplete-closure diagnostic, but it cannot reach
`readiness.implementation: STRUCTURALLY_COMPLETE`. The result exposes `intake.state: READY|BLOCKED` with assurance
`static-structure-and-builder-declared-evidence-only` and `sandboxVerification.state: NOT_RUN`; it is not `verified` or
`accepted`. `--require-prototype-validated` always fails closed with `INDEPENDENT_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED`.

For a prototype, create source, tests, and final evidence artifacts first. Create `gate-status.json` with those evidence
paths, build `review-target.json`, copy its exact hash into the gate status and every completed gate-evidence metadata
record, then rebuild the target. The two targets must be identical. Closure method v10 also binds project-surface
source, test, schema and evidence files. It hashes the evidence artifacts but
not `gate-status.json` or `review-target.json` themselves; `prepare-pr` binds both authority records separately to exact
HEAD and the primary GitHub source request. A gate evidence `commit` is an exact 40-character provenance value and need
not equal the later packaging HEAD.

These checks do not audit, accept, deploy, approve routing or prove availability.
Contributor-controlled `submission.json`, `gate-status.json`, and evidence files can complete only declared prototype
checks. They cannot complete candidate, maintainer-review, deployment, verification, provider, or availability gates.

A prototype also declares at least one successful source-owned GitHub Actions run for the exact primary commit in
`implementation.githubActionsRunIds`. Use the pinned Foundry or npm example under `assets/templates/` as a starting
point and keep the actual build and test commands explicit. The numeric run id, exact workflow blob, repository id,
commit, and tree are source evidence; they are not an independent audit. Registry intake binds those public facts but
never executes candidate code and never decides whether the workflow covers the right security properties. Missing
exact-revision workflow evidence yields `tooling-blocked`, not an unsafe or unsupported-product result.
Pending, cancelled, skipped, and failed runs are not evidence passes and fail before any draft pull request is opened.

For the standard Programmable fee path, declare `implementation.feeConformanceManifestPath` and keep the manifest in
the exact review target. Package verification reruns the Builder's structural fee-conformance checker when that path is
present. A novel fee implementation may omit the standard manifest and enter `architecture-review-required`; it must
not be auto-rejected merely because a fixed template cannot understand it. Maintainers still require semantic and
executable review before implementation conformance.

For prototype product planning, use `submission.json.integration.platformHandoff`. When `intended` is true, provide
concrete `handoffNotes`. The registry, UI, API, indexer, and test paths are contributor proposals and may remain empty
until maintainers accept the exact prototype and assign product work. Contributor packages keep `reviewStatus` at
`not-requested` or `pending-maintainer-review`, `maintainerReviewRequired: true`, `selfApproval: false`, and
`availabilityClaimed: false`.

Prototype gates follow the actual project shape. `routingMode` values `programmable-app` and `custom-reviewed` declare
an included swap client and therefore require its router, view, quoter, SDK, source, test and parity evidence.
`uniswap-interface-api` and `uniswapx-filler` declare an external client, while `not-planned` declares no supplied
client; neither invents app evidence for the builder repository. `dataReconstruction.mode: not-applicable` requires a
fully inactive data profile and is invalid when accounting, claims, external liquidity or a declared indexer needs
reconstruction. A `model-specific-pinned` lock remains builder evidence and candidate review, never maintainer approval.

## Prepare the six-file application package

Commit every reviewed project file, make the builder worktree clean, push its named branch, and confirm that the public
GitHub repository exposes that exact commit. Then run:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" prepare-pr \
  "submissions/$APPLICATION_ID" \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT"
```

For a split project, repeat `--companion-manifest` for each committed manifest:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" prepare-pr \
  "submissions/$APPLICATION_ID" \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT" \
  --companion-manifest ".programmable/companions/backend.json" \
  --companion-manifest ".programmable/companions/game-client.json"
```

Use companion manifest v2 when an npm game, app, or service can declare an exact static closure. It binds the numeric
repository id, commit, root tree, separate source/test/runtime/build paths, package-lock v3 and successful
exact-revision Actions evidence from the closed JSON workflow in `assets/templates/companion-closure-workflow.yml`.
That workflow unconditionally runs the pinned install, named build, and named test steps; the resulting canonical
receipt binds the exact primary manifest path and is also embedded in the central `application.json`. Central intake
re-reads the exact manifest, package, source, runtime and workflow objects and recomputes the receipt before accepting
it. Validate and canonicalize the manifest first with `cli.mjs companion <manifest> --write-canonical`.
For exact historical V1 reproduction or an explicit forward migration, preserve whichever companion-manifest version
the original application used; a historical v1 companion retains its closure-review diagnostic. Do not select this
archival Submission V1 path for a new V2/V3 proposal merely because its build or runtime mechanics are unsupported.

`prepare-pr` independently resolves every declared public repository's numeric id, exact commit, root tree, and
declared paths. It also observes the exact current `0xprogrammable/programmable-registry:main` commit before deriving the
central package. A new application remains revision `1` while its pull request is open. If central main contains
revision n, its open update remains n+1 and must bind a primary or companion source change relative to main. Repeated
project commits or package-only corrections in that same pull request do not increment again. Inconsistent lineage or
a moving central base fails before output is written.

The result separates `sourceHead` from `centralPullRequestTarget`, includes the observed central base commit and next
application revision, and embeds the deterministic six-file package plus the draft PR body consumed by the confirmed
application client. `centralPackage.compatibilityResult` is the authoritative overall application result. The legacy
`submission.preflightDecision` is a design-only compatibility projection and must never be shown as overall readiness.
It does not push a branch or open a pull request.

## Submit or update through the confirmed application client

This is the normal public builder path. Save the canonical `prepare-pr` result outside the source repository, then use
the application client. Do not manually fork the central repository, push a central branch, or open the draft pull
request as an alternative to this flow.

```bash
PREPARED_APPLICATION="/absolute/outside-repo/prepare-pr.json"
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" prepare-pr \
  "submissions/$APPLICATION_ID" \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT" \
  > "$PREPARED_APPLICATION"
```

First create a read-only submit plan. This invocation performs authenticated GitHub reads but no GitHub writes:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" submit \
  --prepared "$PREPARED_APPLICATION" \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT"
```

Review the exact `externalWrites` list and `confirmationDigest`. Only after explicit human authorization, execute that
same current plan with its exact digest:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" submit \
  --prepared "$PREPARED_APPLICATION" \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT" \
  --confirm-external-write "sha256:<exact-plan-digest>"
```

After changing an already-submitted application, regenerate the package for the new exact public source revision and
plan an update to the same open draft. Do not open a replacement draft:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" update \
  --prepared "/absolute/outside-repo/new-prepare-pr.json" \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT" \
  --pull-request "123"
```

Review and explicitly authorize the new update digest before executing that exact current update plan:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" update \
  --prepared "/absolute/outside-repo/new-prepare-pr.json" \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT" \
  --pull-request "123" \
  --confirm-external-write "sha256:<exact-update-plan-digest>"
```

The digest authorizes only the writes enumerated by that current plan; any relevant account, source, base, fork,
branch, pull request, or package change requires a new read-only plan. The client creates or updates a draft only; it
never marks the pull request ready for review. See
[github-application-journey.md](github-application-journey.md) for status, recovery, identity, and intake-state rules.

Large declared path sets are not verified with one anonymous REST request per file. The resolver keeps GitHub REST as
the bounded repository/commit/tree control plane. The central intake reads exact declared objects through one anonymous
HTTPS Git smart-protocol batch per repository; `prepare-pr` may instead bind the clean local primary HEAD bytes against
complete REST tree metadata. Evidence blobs are declared primary-source paths, so central intake retains only those
exact source bytes and reuses them for evidence binding without another REST tree walk or smart-Git fetch. The remote
path uses a blobless partial fetch, a sparse `git backfill` and raw `git cat-file` object reads. It
never checks out project files, recurses into submodules, runs project hooks, loads project or user Git config, supplies
credentials, or executes candidate code. Every returned path must still be a regular blob under the exact requested
commit and root tree; its raw object id, two-megabyte file ceiling, twenty-megabyte aggregate ceiling and non-LFS bytes
are checked.
GitHub recursive-tree truncation is never treated as evidence: the same exact-object path proof is required instead.
Git 2.49.0 or newer is required and the `git backfill` capability is probed before any repository fetch. If the
installed Git cannot provide this no-checkout flow, the result is `TOOLING_BLOCKED`, not an unsafe rejection.
The central source control plane admits at most 48 REST requests and reserves 12 additional physical request slots for
bounded transport retries. At 125 ms pacing, all admitted pacing plus worst-case retry delay is 19.375 seconds inside
the 30-second deadline. Provider throttling, exhausted anonymous quota, incomplete fallback data, and local tooling
failure remain system/tooling blockers; none is converted into a finding that an unusual project is unsafe.
Accepted source content is hard-capped at two megabytes per file and twenty megabytes per repository. Exact-Git runs
as a detached process group whose leader and helpers inherit a 64 MiB regular-file limit and a 20 CPU-second limit;
Linux additionally enforces a 512 MiB address-space limit. Output is byte-bounded. Aggregate temporary Git storage has
a separate 64 MiB process-monitor cap and post-command measurement; it is fail-closed but is not a native filesystem
quota, so multiple fast writes can briefly overshoot before the complete process group is killed and the temporary
repository is removed. A successful leader is also followed by a group kill so a remote helper or `index-pack` cannot
survive the bounded operation.

## Maintainer-only manual recovery fallback

The rest of this section is not the normal public builder path. It is reserved for an explicitly authorized central
repository maintainer recovering from an application-client incident. Ordinary builders must use the confirmed
`submit` or `update` flow above. Manual central materialization, commits, pushes, forks, or pull-request creation are
not an equivalent builder workflow.

To materialize the generated files, pass an explicit new target directory outside the builder source repository. Its
parent `submissions/` directory must already exist, the target itself must not exist, and its basename must equal the
application id:

```bash
CENTRAL_APPLICATION_DIR="/absolute/path/to/clean-programmable-fork/submissions/$APPLICATION_ID"
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" prepare-pr \
  "submissions/$APPLICATION_ID" \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT" \
  --output-dir "$CENTRAL_APPLICATION_DIR"
```

The `--output-dir` form creates that target and writes only the six canonical files listed above. It refuses an existing
target or a basename that differs from the application id. With the separate path shown above, the builder source
repository remains unchanged. The command still performs no push or pull-request creation. Review the generated files
and reported hashes before committing them to the separate clean central-repository branch. The CLI does not discover a
central checkout or infer this path for the builder.

For the first update after revision n is merged, refresh the clean central checkout to the exact base commit reported
by `prepare-pr`. Then replace only that byte-exact main package:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" prepare-pr \
  "submissions/$APPLICATION_ID" \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT" \
  --output-dir "$CENTRAL_APPLICATION_DIR" \
  --replace-existing
```

`--replace-existing` refuses a missing target, extra file, symlink, hard link, stale byte, wrong prior revision, or
different observed central base. It uses a verified local replacement with rollback; it is not a push, merge, or
single-system-call cross-platform atomic publication.

For every later commit or package-only correction in that same open pull request, replace the current local draft with:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" prepare-pr \
  "submissions/$APPLICATION_ID" \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT" \
  --output-dir "$CENTRAL_APPLICATION_DIR" \
  --replace-draft
```

`--replace-draft` snapshots the exact six non-executable regular files before public resolution, binds them to current
immutable main, preserves the pending revision and full numeric repository lineage, then rechecks directory, file
inodes, bytes, and main stability before a rollback-capable swap. It does not prove which pull request owns the local
directory, so use it only for the already-open application pull request you are updating.

### Maintainer recovery: open a draft pull request manually

Only the authorized maintainer handling the incident may perform these recovery steps:

1. Keep the complete project in its own public GitHub repository and verify the exact clean revision prepared above.
2. Use the maintainer-approved fork of [`0xprogrammable/programmable-registry`](https://github.com/0xprogrammable/programmable-registry).
3. Create a recovery branch from the exact observed central `main` commit.
4. Materialize exactly the generated six files into `submissions/<application-id>/`.
5. Confirm that the central diff contains no project source, extra submission files, registry edits, or workflows.
6. Push the recovery branch only under the incident's explicit external-write authorization.
7. Open one draft pull request against `0xprogrammable/programmable-registry:main` with the generated PR body.

Do not edit the model registry, create an acceptance record or set candidate status. Submission contents are untrusted
input. Intake automation must use trusted code from the base repository and must not execute contributor-supplied
scripts with credentials, signing access or repository write permission.

The central repository's `main` branch holds bounded application and release-evidence records. It is neither the
builder-project source branch nor the website production branch. Never put project source or a website release into an
application PR.

## Pull request contents

A submission PR states:

- Stage: proposal or prototype
- Exact authoritative design and implementation readiness, compatibility-only legacy decision, and risk tier
- User outcome, project surfaces, and model difference
- Whether the mandatory fee hook uses the standard profile or integrates additional project-defined behavior; permissions and mask when `hook.used` is true
- Assets, fees, custody, value flow, authorities, and dependencies
- Tests actually run and tests still required
- Known limitations and open decisions
- Builder GitHub identity and one contact handle
- License and third-party provenance
- Optional beneficiary address for a future accepted release

The PR must not include private keys, seed phrases, API tokens, RPC credentials, private vulnerability details, personal
data not required for attribution, or misleading approval and revenue claims.

## Review boundary

The agent may:

- Create and validate local files
- Explain findings and propose redesigns
- Prepare the local application package and a read-only GitHub action plan

The agent may not, without separate explicit authority:

- Confirm external GitHub writes, open or update the pull request, or merge it
- Write a maintainer acceptance record
- Add the submission to the release registry
- Deploy or sign transactions
- Submit to Uniswap Hooklist or routing intake
- Promise a response time, acceptance, launch count, trading volume, or revenue

## After maintainer acceptance

An accepted model moves to a separate platform-integration handoff. Confirm that the acceptance record resolves to the
same model id, version, prototype commit, submission hash, review-target hash, scope, and open conditions as the reviewed
package. A merged PR, passing tests, candidate record, or maintainer comment is not a substitute.

After that identity is fixed, copy `assets/templates/launch-bundle-input.example.json` into the evidence root outside
the accepted source revision and fill every field from actual local bytes. Generate the candidate with:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" launch-bundle \
  --repository-root "$REPOSITORY_ROOT" \
  --registry-root "/path/to/exact/programmable-registry-checkout" \
  --evidence-root "/path/to/immutable-launch-evidence" \
  --submission "path/to/submission.json" \
  --bindings "path/to/launch-bundle-input.json"
```

`--submission` is relative to the accepted source root. `--bindings` and optional `--write` are relative to the evidence
root. The command validates the filled input against `launch-bundle-input-v1.schema.json` and the derived bundle against
`launch-bundle-output-v1.schema.json` before emitting or writing it.

The source and Registry checkouts must have the exact bound commit, tree, canonical GitHub origin, clean tracked state,
and committed submission, review target and acceptance bytes. Build settings, dependency locks and artifact source must
come from the accepted source revision; build output, artifact JSON and verification evidence must come from the
separate evidence root. Every bound file is a regular file with an exact SHA-256. Artifact JSON pointers select creation
and deployed bytecode; the Builder derives constructor, init-code and runtime hashes rather than accepting free
runtime-hash claims. Missing, cross-root or mismatched provenance fails closed.

The result contains the exact current-private Admin `DeploymentSpecV1`, `LaunchExecutorCallV1`, decoded
`PoolConfigurationV1`, PoolId, source/artifact/evidence hashes, target and hook expected runtime hashes, and the three
executor configuration hashes. It always remains `NOT_AUTHORIZED`, `runtimeEvidence.state: NOT_RUN`,
`deploymentEvidence.state: NOT_PROVIDED`, unsigned and unexecuted. Admin must independently verify canonical Registry
head/authenticity, hermetic builds, accepted source closure, onchain code at a pinned block, configuration, fee
conformance, current gate state and signing authority. A bundle candidate is not a permit or deployment receipt.

Load `official-model-patterns.md` when the release derives from an official pattern. Load
`routing-and-discovery.md` for product indexing, discovery, Hooklist, quoting, routing, and provider boundaries.

The handoff must define every accepted or intended UI, app, game, API, service, keeper, oracle, indexer, quote, trade,
claim, and monitoring surface:

- Human owner and exact repository paths
- Source of truth and dependency trust level
- Inputs, outputs, schemas, events, or transaction states
- Chain, model version, contracts, SDKs, router, Permit2, and provider assumptions
- Errors, stale data, reorgs, retries, partial fills, recovery, and unsupported states where relevant
- Executable integration checks and the evidence required to call them passed
- Feature gate, rollout plan, and rollback limitation

For an intended trading surface, the product team must be able to trace one quote through execution, receipt
reconciliation, indexed state, displayed state, and any claim without changing PoolKey, direction, exactness, amount
semantics, hookData when used, or accepted configuration along the way. Other surfaces need the equivalent end-to-end
trace for their declared user action and value flow.

The handoff also carries a gate ledger. Keep these decisions separate:

1. Maintainer acceptance
2. Platform implementation review
3. Deployment authorization
4. Deployment execution
5. Source verification
6. Runtime matching
7. Lifecycle verification
8. Monitoring readiness
9. Hooklist, routing, indexing, and discovery-provider decisions
10. Product activation and availability

Each gate names its owner, exact evidence, current state, blocker, and next action. One gate never grants authority for
the next. A completed post-acceptance gate points to a maintainer-owned record bound to the accepted release; a
contributor gate record cannot satisfy it.

Registry, UI, API, indexer, and executable-test review use the candidate gates
`programmable-registry-integration-review`, `programmable-ui-integration-review`,
`programmable-api-integration-review`, `programmable-indexer-integration-review`, and
`programmable-integration-test-review`. Uniswap routing stays external as `uniswap-hook-routing-review`; permissioned
pools add `permissioned-pool-routing-allowlist`.
Quote, trade, claim, and monitoring stay as separate evidence rows inside integration-test review; no row is inferred
from another.

Platform changes target `production`, not `main`, and only the integration owner may combine them. Preparing a handoff
does not modify product code. Creating a product branch or PR, merging, deploying, verifying, submitting provider forms,
and activating the model each require their own task and authority.

## Security reports

Never disclose an unpatched vulnerability in a public proposal or PR. Use the repository's private vulnerability
reporting process.
