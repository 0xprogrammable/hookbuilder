## Purpose

Use the catalog to start common projects faster and ask the right architecture, security, evidence and disclosure
questions. A catalog entry is an accelerator only. It is not an allowlist, implementation, acceptance decision, audit,
deployment receipt, provider promise or launch permit.

Never infer that an idea is unsafe, rejected or unsupported because its category is absent. Preserve every owner-defined
capability, describe its actors, assets, authorities, value flows, dependencies and failure behavior, and route it to
architecture review. Objective hard findings still come from the main policy and evidence workflow, not this catalog.

Every starter includes the mandatory Programmable volume-fee, metadata/disclosure and test/evidence packs. This helps
builders remember required launch facts. The generated planning files do not prove that the fee implementation or any
other behavior exists.

## Selection model

Choose one starter, then add any number of capability packs:

1. Use `ordinary-launch` for the smallest conventional fixed-supply token and canonical-pool path.
2. Use `custom-token-standard-fee-hook` when special behavior belongs in the token while the Programmable fee hook
   remains standard.
3. Use `custom-hook` when the canonical pool needs custom callbacks; token-side packs can still be added.
4. Use `blank-custom` when a known starter would distort the idea.
5. Add packs for each actual behavior or product surface.
6. Add every unlisted behavior with `--custom-capability` rather than omitting or renaming it.
7. Add any safe project-specific discovery slugs with repeatable `--local-tag`; catalog membership is not required.
8. Resolve a template-composition conflict by selecting a better foundation. A composition conflict is not a safety or
   eligibility decision.

Pack dependencies are included automatically. Output ordering, definition hashes, catalog digest and selection digest
are deterministic. The same catalog and selection produce byte-identical files.

## Commands

Resolve `SKILL_ROOT` to the directory containing the loaded `SKILL.md`.

List the complete catalog:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/template-catalog.mjs" list
```

List only starters or packs:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/template-catalog.mjs" list --kind starter
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/template-catalog.mjs" list --kind pack
```

Inspect one hash-bound definition:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/template-catalog.mjs" show threejs-pvp-rewards
```

Materialize a conventional launch into a target that does not exist:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/template-catalog.mjs" materialize \
  --starter ordinary-launch \
  --target /absolute/path/to/new-project-plan
```

Materialize token-side transfer tax and tax-financed liquidity while keeping the standard fee hook:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/template-catalog.mjs" materialize \
  --starter custom-token-standard-fee-hook \
  --pack tax-financed-auto-liquidity \
  --target /absolute/path/to/new-token-plan
```

Materialize an open-ended game with known and owner-defined capabilities:

```bash
node "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/template-catalog.mjs" materialize \
  --starter custom-hook \
  --pack threejs-pvp-rewards \
  --custom-capability moving-arena='Moving arena changes the next swap rule' \
  --local-tag community-tournament \
  --target /absolute/path/to/new-game-plan
```

The command performs local reads and creates only the new target. It does not initialize Git, fetch dependencies, run
project code, connect a wallet, submit an application, deploy or publish.

## Starters

| Starter | Use it for | Route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ordinary-launch` | Fixed-supply token, conventional price discovery and the smallest behavior surface | Standard review |
| `custom-token-standard-fee-hook` | Token-side special behavior with the standard Programmable fee hook | Custom review |
| `custom-hook` | One custom canonical-pool hook with integrated fee behavior | Custom review |
| `blank-custom` | Any idea that does not fit a known foundation without distortion | Architecture review |

The ordinary starter cannot accept `custom-hook-behavior`, whether selected directly or pulled in by another pack. The
command returns `CUSTOM_HOOK_STARTER_REQUIRED` with `recommendedStarterId: custom-hook`; preserve the idea and selected
packs, then continue with `--starter custom-hook`. Token-side special packs instead return
`CUSTOM_TOKEN_STARTER_REQUIRED` with `recommendedStarterId: custom-token-standard-fee-hook`.

The custom-token starter accepts token-side packs without pulling in `custom-hook-behavior`. If a selected pack does
need custom callbacks, it redirects to `custom-hook`, where the token-side pack remains composable. A permissioned or
external asset does not conflict with `ordinary-launch` merely because it is external: record whether its PoolKey role
is `launched`, `quote` or `both`, then derive the actual architecture and review obligations. Foundation routing is not
a rejection or safety decision.

Selecting `token-transfer-tax`, `token-managed-automatic-liquidity`, or `tax-financed-auto-liquidity` requires the
corresponding fields in the top-level `tokenMechanics` profile. The standard-fee-hook custom-token starter keeps those
mechanics token-side; it does not force `custom-hook-behavior`. Legacy unpublished `1.4.0` drafts may retain an
equivalent nested profile under `noHookArchitecture`, but two divergent declarations are invalid.

Packs are composable prompts and output templates, not code mixins. A selected pack still requires an implementation
that matches the project, plus the main skill's compatibility, security, source-binding and review gates.

## Owner-defined capabilities

Use a lowercase hyphenated id and a visible NFC label:

```text
--custom-capability capability-id='Plain visible label'
```

The materialized manifest records:

- `catalogStatus: unlisted`
- `automaticDecision: none`
- `reviewRoute: architecture-review-required`
- `eligibilityEffect: none`

The generated checklist asks for actors and assets, authority and trust, value flow and conservation, failure and exit,
and exact source and tests. Continue the normal architecture conversation to derive more specific obligations. Do not
invent a near-enough known label merely to avoid review.

## Owner-defined local tags

Use repeatable lowercase slug-safe tags for local discovery without waiting for a catalog update:

```text
--local-tag weird-squid-market --local-tag community-lore
```

These values are deliberately not checked against a tag allowlist. They are NFC-safe lowercase slugs, required to be
unique, sorted, included in the selection digest, stored as `tagSuggestions.ownerProvidedLocalTags`, and rendered in
`TAGS.md`. `catalogMembershipRequired` is `false`, `machineCapabilityInference` is `forbidden`, and
`providerSupportInference` is `forbidden`.

Starter, pack, security and capability ids live separately under `machineCapabilities`. They support internal planning
and review routing, but never become public local tags automatically. Owner-defined capabilities also remain machine
capabilities until the owner separately chooses a `--local-tag`. Therefore `ownerProvidedLocalTags` is the only list of
explicit public local discovery suggestions in a materialized plan.

A local tag describes the owner's project only. It never proves or claims GMGN, Fomo, Dexscreener, Uniswap, wallet,
router, marketplace or search-provider support. Track each external provider separately from attributable evidence.

## Composition rules

The loader rejects malformed packaged data before materialization:

- unknown or missing fields in the closed catalog objects;
- noncanonical ids or paths;
- duplicate or unsorted ids;
- hash mismatches, unlisted files or missing definitions;
- invalid, non-NFC, invisible, control, bidirectional, private-use or noncharacter label text;
- missing mandatory packs, dangling requirements or requirement cycles;
- a selected starter/pack pair with contradictory template assumptions.

In addition, `ordinary-launch` composition stops with a specific `custom-hook` redirect whenever dependency closure
contains `custom-hook-behavior`. The selected behavior remains eligible and can be composed unchanged on the
`custom-hook` starter. Token-side special packs redirect ordinary composition to
`custom-token-standard-fee-hook`. Selecting custom-hook behavior from that token foundation redirects to
`custom-hook`, which can combine both behavior families.

A composition conflict means only that the selected templates cannot describe one coherent foundation. It returns
`eligibilityEffect: none` and `adverseDecision: false`. Change the selection while preserving the original idea.

## Materialized files

The target contains exactly:

- `programmable-template.json` — catalog and selection digests, selected definitions, separated machine capabilities,
  custom capabilities and owner-provided local tags;
- `PROPOSAL.md` — outcome, architecture facts, lifecycle, value and authority questions;
- `CAPABILITY_CHECKLIST.md` — selected known and owner-defined capabilities;
- `THREAT_MODEL.md` — capability-specific risk prompts and security-property section;
- `TEST_PLAN.md` — required scenarios, adversarial checks and reproducibility section;
- `EVIDENCE.md` — required artifacts and separate evidence states;
- `TAGS.md` — only owner-provided local slug suggestions plus a separate provider-evidence table;
- `METADATA_AND_DISCLOSURES.md` — public identity, fees, controls, tags and per-provider evidence.

Replace prompts with project-specific facts. Leaving template text unchanged is not implementation or evidence.

## Adding a catalog entry

Keep additions data-only and reviewable:

1. Add one closed JSON definition under `assets/starter-catalog/starters/` or `assets/starter-catalog/packs/`.
2. Use a unique lowercase hyphenated id and visible NFC text.
3. State required facts, files, tests and risks without claiming approval.
4. Add only real composition dependencies or conflicts. Do not use conflicts as a disguised product allowlist.
5. Add the sorted manifest entry with the exact raw-file SHA-256.
6. Add focused tests for selection, dependency closure, conflicts and unknown-capability preservation.
7. Run the complete catalog test and the skill verification gates before a release candidate.

Do not add executable downloads, remote URLs, credentials, wallet actions or provider assertions to the catalog.

## Evidence boundary

A valid catalog and deterministic materialization prove only that packaged template bytes and selection rules are
self-consistent. They do not prove source behavior, fee correctness, security review, clean builds, deployment, source
verification, lifecycle operation, provider indexing, routing or public availability. Track those states independently
through the main Programmable workflow.
